A personal website for a programmer with a sticky header. The website should include sections like About, Portfolio, Blog, and Contact. It should have a modern, clean design that highlights the programmer's skills and projects. The header should remain fixed at the top when users scroll down the page, ensuring easy navigation at all times. Include a responsive layout for various devices and a professional color scheme.
